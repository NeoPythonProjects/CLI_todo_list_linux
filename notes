based on:
-------
project based on the link below (although there are errors in that code as at 3 December 2021)
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-a-todo-list-cli-application-using-python/

usage
-----
./todo

link
----
the todo.txt file reference is hardcoded for a debian environment (mine is a rasberry pi)
with a link set up in the home directory to the todo.sh file in the ToDoList directory
where the todo.sh file starts the todo.py file

$ ln -s /Documents/ToDoList/todo.sh todo

todo.sh
-------
#!/bin/bash
python ~/Documents/ToDoList/todo.py "$@"


the "$@" needs to be in double quotes, it converts all arguments to words in "", so doesn't split them up
see BASH scripting course
